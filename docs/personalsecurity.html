            <h5>Knowing how to prevent attacks from every source:</h5>
            <p>In order to prevent everything from major viral infection to the tinniest of spam emails, knowing your own
            habits is key. You have to start prevention from the source. And that is yourself. We commonly don't read long
            disclaimers and see ourselves as pioneers of surfing the web. But there is a fatal truth. There will always be
            someone who is one step ahead, and someone who knows how you think and how to do it better. You're job is simply
            to make sure you never meet.</p>

                    Virtual Private Networks, can aid is masking your computers location, along with IP, previous webpages,
                    and other information vital to tracking you.</p>

                        password protected application, preferably local, rather than saving your passwords to a database online
                        such as Google or Microsoft Edge. These can easily be detected and through manipulation of source page material,
                        be remotely accessed through your account. A single account should not be used to manage all of your other
                        existing ones.</p>

                functions that can be changed to reduce this trail. Tor, for example, is built in with features for exactly this purpose.</p>
